## I'm a Python!

### Reverse Engineering, 50pts

I wrote this python file! [Python](https://cdn.rawgit.com/mdhack/ctf/3b64afac/im_a_python.py)

My friend Joey Kim used to warn me about the danger of the internet. So I used the coolest base-16 encoding to keep it secret. But... It doesn't seem to be running... I guess there are errors in the code I wrote?

Can you please help me find the original flag back?

**Hint:**

1. You will need [Python](https://www.python.org/) on your computer to solve this flag.
2. I adapted and modified this problem from another game. It does not start with mdhc but something else. But it is rather obvious. Just look for the text inside the pair of { }.
