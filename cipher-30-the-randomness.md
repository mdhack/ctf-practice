## The randomness?

### Cipher, 30pts

Flag:  mdhc{subst1tut10n\_1s\_v3ry\_3asy\_t0\_crack}

##### How to break it:

Step 1: git gud.

Step 2: ignore step one.

##### The Legit way to break the cipher:

At a first glance, it is a text file. Then, you open the text file\(hardest step\). And you find the encrypted plaintext, or ciphertext. There are no hints, so, that doesn't help at all. We did some work with ciphers in AP CSP. We only covered Caeser cipher and Vigenere ciphers. There are brute forcers online for both, but none of them work. So, since we don't know the method of encryption, but both the Caeser and the Vigenere ciphers clasify as subsitution ciphers! So we search up "subsitution cipher solver" on google, and try the websites one by one. The second website worked! ![](/assets/Capture1.PNG)More easy points!
