## Useless JavaScript

### Reverse Engineering, 80pts

What are thoooooose!!!

Some lord wrote this JavaScript file... Can you get the hidden flag?

Wait... Is there only one flag? Multiple flags? One flag and multiple fake flags? Multiple flags and one fake flag? ...

Always look for the MD Hack Club signature when you think you got a flag... It always look like: `mdhc{flag_content}`



**Hint: **

You might not actually need to go through all that crap.
