## Maybe Flag Discount Package

### Binary, 120pts

**Warning: This problem will take a lot of time. Get prepared.**

You love looking for flags don't you?

Here's an entire package of flags \(8-in-1 deal\) value pack! However... I know that only one flag within the package is valid. And we ship via the great American shipping company XedEf. Um... But we didn't package it really well and it was a relatively long and bumpy trip so you might receive the package damaged... But I believe you can fix that yourself.

So good luck ;\)

**XedEf tracking number:**
